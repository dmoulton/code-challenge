## Scenario 2

Do you know what Wikipedia’s problem is? Out of over 300 languages they support, they don’t
have a Pig Latin version. Create a Ruby on Rails application that builds a Pig Latin version of
any article that exists in the English language Wikipedia. (e.g., if I want a pig latin version of the
article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin, I’d go to http://localhost/wiki/Pig_Latin and the app
would translate that article into Pig Latin for me.)
