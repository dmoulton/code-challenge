# Scenario 1

Using Ruby on Rails, write an API that accepts a post request with a UTF-8 string payload and
returns a ROT-13 version of the string, storing the original string in a database of your choice
(SQLite, MongoDB, PostgreSQL/MySQL). The API should be capable of accepting a string of
1,000 characters. No 3rd party libraries or gems may be used for ROT-13.
