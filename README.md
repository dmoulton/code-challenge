# Code Challenge - Fund that Flip

Please come prepared with a code sample. It can be something you have written recently and
want to use to showcase your programming style. We would expect to see examples of your
code primarily in Ruby on Rails, additionally you may share examples from other languages
such as React.

In addition to your own coding samples, we would like you to complete two of the following
coding challenges. During the interview, you will be asked to share your screen and walk our
team through your code. Do not provide any sample code that belongs to a current or previous
employer.

## Scenario 1

Using Ruby on Rails, write an API that accepts a post request with a UTF-8 string payload and
returns a ROT-13 version of the string, storing the original string in a database of your choice
(SQLite, MongoDB, PostgreSQL/MySQL). The API should be capable of accepting a string of
1,000 characters. No 3rd party libraries or gems may be used for ROT-13.

## Scenario 2

Do you know what Wikipedia’s problem is? Out of over 300 languages they support, they don’t
have a Pig Latin version. Create a Ruby on Rails application that builds a Pig Latin version of
any article that exists in the English language Wikipedia. (e.g., if I want a pig latin version of the
article https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pig_Latin, I’d go to http://localhost/wiki/Pig_Latin and the app
would translate that article into Pig Latin for me.)

## Scenario 3

Write a function in Ruby that takes two parameters, both are numbers. The function should
multiply the numbers and return the result. However, there is a catch, you are not allowed to use
the * operator. Then write a second function which takes two numbers and returns the result of
the first number raised to the power of the second number. Again, you may not use either the *
or the ** operators.
